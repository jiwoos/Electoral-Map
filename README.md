- The year chart allows you to visualize different election years where you can select a specific year to explore.
- The electoral vote chart visualizes the winning party and the number of electoral votes corresponding to each state.
- The vote percentage chart displays the percentage of votes won by each party and independent candidates in some cases.
- The tile chart visualizes the same data as the electoral vote chart but provides geospatial context. In addition, this will also display the distribution of votes within a state.
